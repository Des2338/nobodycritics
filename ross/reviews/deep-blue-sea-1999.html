                    <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> may be showing its age, but its premise still holds together surprisingly well,
                    making it one of the more underrated shark movies of its era.

            <h2>Review</h2>

            <p>
                Rewatching <em>Deep Blue Sea</em>, one of the biggest positives is that the premise actually makes sense.
                The film gives a clear and believable reason for why the sharks are more intelligent than normal, and it
                sticks to that explanation without turning them into full-on movie monsters. Even with their enhanced
                intelligence, the sharks still behave like animals, which helps keep the movie grounded despite how
                wild the situation becomes.
            </p>

            <p>
                LL Cool J easily steals the show. He strikes the perfect balance between comic relief and competence,
                making him one of the few characters you actively want to survive — and thankfully, he does. His humor
                never tips the movie into parody, and his presence adds a lot of personality to an otherwise chaotic
                situation. Several of the death scenes throughout the film are also genuinely memorable, helping the
                movie maintain its cult reputation.
            </p>

            <h2>What Worked</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A premise that’s surprisingly logical and consistent</li>
                <li>LL Cool J’s standout performance</li>
                <li>Memorable deaths and strong entertainment value</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Didn’t</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Many characters feel bland or outright annoying</li>
                <li>CGI effects haven’t aged particularly well</li>
                <li>The final act feels rushed once the chaos escalates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> is one of those movies that clearly shows its age, especially when it comes to
                visual effects, but it still holds up where it counts. The film understands its own premise and never
                abandons it, which goes a long way toward keeping the story engaging even when things get over the top.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest issue is that many of the characters simply aren’t compelling enough to make every moment
                of danger feel impactful. While the movie does take time early on to establish its key players, once
                the shark attacks ramp up, the pacing shifts into overdrive and starts racing toward the finish line.
                That rush weakens some of the tension that the story works hard to build.
            </p>

            <p>
                Still, this is an entertaining and underrated shark movie that earns its cult status. It’s fun, it’s
                memorable, and it knows exactly what kind of movie it wants to be. I give <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> a
                <strong>7 out of 10</strong>.
