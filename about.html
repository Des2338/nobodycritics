        <p>I’m Daniel, and movies have been part of my world for as long as I can remember.
        It really took off when I discovered The Making Of, that behind-the-scenes show 
        AMC used to air after N.Y.U.K. (a Three Stooges sketch block AMC used to run).
        Watching how a story comes together behind the camera hooked me instantly and never let go.
        <br><br>
        My favorites cover a pretty wild range—from The Thing all the way to the heart-warming
        It’s a Wonderful Life. That alone should say plenty. I like movies that tell great stories,
        not only through writing but through visuals.
        <br><br>
        I grew up on The Twilight Zone, House, M.D., and The Three Stooges. Those shows shaped what I
        look for today: sharp storytelling, memorable characters, and a little bit of chaos used just right.
        <br><br>
        When I watch something, I’m taking in every detail—the shot that frames the talent perfectly, the cut
        that builds the scare, the line that hits right in the heart. And when the credits roll, I’m the guy
        heading straight for the behind-the-scenes to see how they pulled off the moments I loved.
        <br><br>
        And yes, I still keep a Blu-ray collection alive. Digital is convenient, but nothing beats owning the
        real thing.
        <br><br>
        Nobody Critics is my place to talk about movies the way I experience them—honest, curious, relaxed, and
        always excited about the craft behind the story.</p><!---I need the text to kind of float around the image. I think i need to floatthe image to the left.-->

        <p>I’m Joe Ross—a communications grad who grew up believing weekend pilgrimages to Regal Cinemas were just
            part of childhood. Every Saturday it was me, my sister, and my grandmother catching whatever was on the
            big screen (shoutout to A Bug’s Life for being the gateway), followed by a post-film debrief over Burger
            King fries.<br><br>

            Somewhere between those matinees and my adult binges of movies and series, I picked up a fascination with
            how films are made—especially when they featured the actors and actresses I’ve followed for years. I love
            digging into performances, chasing down the story threads, and seeing what really makes a film click.<br><br>

            And for the record, Gladiator still holds the throne. Yes, I quote it. No, I’m not stopping.</p>
