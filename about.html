        My love for film started with a simple tradition. Every weekend growing up, my family would head to the movie theater,
        watch whatever was playing, then grab food afterward. Somewhere between the popcorn and the big screen, movies became
        more than entertainment — they became home.
    </p>

    <p>
        After <em>N.Y.U.K.</em> on AMC came a show called <em>The Making Of</em>, and that series flipped a switch. Seeing how films
        were built — the lighting rigs, practical effects, makeup, and the teamwork behind every shot — sparked a curiosity that
        never really went away.

        When I watch a movie, I’m paying attention to how it’s made. Camera placement, color choices, pacing, sound design —
        the technical decisions that shape how a story feels. When the credits roll, I’m usually diving straight into the
        behind-the-scenes to understand how my favorite moments were pulled off.

        Nobody Critics exists because movies hit people differently. What resonates with one viewer may not work for another,
        and that’s part of the experience. We believe honest discussion — without hype or agendas — is what makes film culture
        worth engaging with.
    </p>

    <p>
        This site isn’t about chasing trends or pretending to be experts. It’s about watching films with intention, breaking
        down what works and what doesn’t, and appreciating the craft behind the stories we love.
    </p>

        At the end of the day, we’re just movie fans who care deeply about the process. Reviews from nobodies — for everybody.
