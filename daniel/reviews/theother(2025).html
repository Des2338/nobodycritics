                A young couple hoping to start a family adopts a mute child, and their dream begins to unravel. A silent child and dark secrets—a combination that invites fear and unease.

            <h2>Review</h2>

            <p>
                What really drew me into <em>The Other</em> was the idea of a mute child being brought into a home  of too her, is strangers. When a character can’t communicate what they’re seeing or feeling, especially in a horror story, that creates built-in unease. The film leans into that early.
            </p>

            <p>
                The story follows Daniel and Robin, a young couple who adopt Catalina, a quiet orphan, hoping to finally have the family they couldn’t create on their own. Not long after she arrives, things begin to decay. Food rots, mold spreads, and the house starts to feel infected — like something unseen has latched on and is feeding off the family.
            </p>

            <p>
                The movie constantly shifts your perspective on who or what the real threat is. Is Catalina dangerous? Is she a victim? Or is something else attached to her, twisting everyone around her while she’s unable to explain what’s really happening?
            </p>


            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                This is a movie where I could clearly see what it was trying to do — especially visually. The symbolism isn’t subtle, but it feels intentional. The rotting food, creeping mold, and that thick pink slime in the pool all point toward ideas of birth, contamination, and parasitism. I wasn’t just being told something was wrong — I was watching it rot in real time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The pool sex scene is a good example of that. It’s meant to be intimate, but instead it feels uncomfortable and disgusting. The idea of having sex in a pool filled with an unknown pink substance is unsettling, and honestly, it would probably drive a germaphobe crazy. That mix of attraction and revulsion worked for me — it made the moment feel wrong in a way that felt intentional.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the strongest tension scenes is when Daniel goes to meet the previous foster family. The house feels off, flies are seen flying around food, and the forced hospitality makes the whole interaction feel tense. Nothing outright terrifying happens, but every instinct says not to trust what you’re seeing. Those are the kinds of scenes I love — they just needed to sit in that discomfort a little longer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The attic hammer scene is a genuine “oh shit” moment. When that hammer comes into play, it finally feels dangerous and irreversible, like the movie has crossed a line. Unfortunately, the film doesn’t stay in that space long enough, easing off instead of riding the tension forward.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ending has the bones of something disturbing, but camera angles and pacing hold it back. If the shots had been tighter and more claustrophobic, the final scare would have carried more weight. Instead, it softens what should have been a stronger payoff.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’d give <em>The Other</em> a 6 out of 10. It’s worth watching if you enjoy independent horror that leans into atmosphere and ideas rather than nonstop scares. I don’t see myself revisiting it, but I am curious to see what this director does next. There’s potential here — it just needed tighter pacing and more confidence in its strongest moments.
            </p>

                        <h2>What Worked</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong use of color grading and lighting throughout</li>
                <li>Clear visual symbolism tied to birth, decay, and parasitism</li>
                <li>A few genuine “oh shit” moments that land</li>
                <li>Disability representation handled naturally and respectfully</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Didn’t</h2>

                <li>Inconsistent pacing that breaks tension</li>
                <li>Awkward scenes that should have felt tense</li>
                <li>Some strong setups without strong follow-through</li>
            </ul>
